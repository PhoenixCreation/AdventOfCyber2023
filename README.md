# Advent of Cyber 2023 Walkthrough

Hi, I am [PhoenixCreation](https://tryhackme.com/p/PhoenixCreation) and this repo contains all the walkthroughs for the [Advent of Cyber 2023](https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber2023) hosted by [tryhackme.com](tryhackme.com)

I will be releasing each day's walkthrough as they are released. You can find them inside the walkthrough folder.

Some things about the walkthroughs:
- I will not be showing the final answers/flags. You are supposed to learn from this and not just copy and paste things.
- I am assuming that readers have some basic knowledge of the things regarding the cybersecurity, I will try to keep it as simple as possible, but I might come across a little jumpy sometimes.
- I will try to explain everything as much as possible in details and my thought process. You can have your own opinion and I will love to hear them.
- I will add TL;DR section for each day to give you some idea of what you will be learning.
